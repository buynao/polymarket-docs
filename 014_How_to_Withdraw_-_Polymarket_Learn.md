# How to Withdraw#

Withdrawing from Polymarket is simple, instant, and free.

Go to the Polymarket funds page and click on the **Withdraw** button.

Enter the USDC address you wish to withdraw to. Make sure the address supports USDC on the Polygon network. Then, enter the amount you want to withdraw.

Click **Withdraw**. Your funds will be transferred instantly.

Note: When withdrawing USDC.e (bridged USDC) is swapped through the **[Uniswap v3 pool](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd36ec33c8bed5a9f7b6630855f1533455b98a418)** for USDC (native) (the UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output amount). At times, this pool may be exhausted and for extremely large deposits there might not be enough liquidity. If you are having withdraw issues, try breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be rebalanced. Additionally, you can select to withdraw USDC.e directly which does not require any Uniswap liquidity; just be aware that some exchanges no longer allow USDC.e to be deposited directly.
