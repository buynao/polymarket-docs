# Large Cross Chain Deposits#

**For deposits over $50,000 we recommended to use bridges and ensure minimal fee's (slippage).**

## Recommended Bridges#

  * **[DeBridge](https://app.debridge.finance/?inputChain=1&outputChain=137&inputCurrency=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&outputCurrency=0x3c499c542cef5e3811e1192ce70d8cc03d5c3359&dlnMode=simple)**

For large deposits (>$50,000) originating from a chain other than Polygon, we recommend using one of the aforementioned bridges. Ensure you bridge to your Polymarket USDC (Polygon) **[deposit address](https://polymarket.com/wallet)** (screenshot below). Please be mindful of potential slippage during the transaction.

Polymarket is not affiliated with, responsible for, or makes any guarantees regarding any third-party bridge. Users are advised to review the Terms of Use or other relevant documentation for third-party bridges.

## Important Notes#

You can deposit USDC or USDC.e to your Polymarket Polygon wallet.

If you deposit USDC (native), you will be prompted to "activate funds," which will swap this to USDC.e via the lowest fee Uniswap pool, ensuring slippage of less than 10 basis points (bps).

If you encounter any issues with the deposit process, please reach out to us on Discord for assistance.
