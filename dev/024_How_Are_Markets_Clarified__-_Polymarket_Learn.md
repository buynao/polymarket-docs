Markets

# Market Rules#

## Overview#

  * Markets are resolved according to the rules set forth on the market page.

  * The rules specify the resolution source, the market end date, and they outline how the market should resolve in various edge-cases.

  * The market title describes the market, but the rules define how it should be resolved.




It is important to read the rules before trading in a market.

## Clarifications#

In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market’s creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an “Additional context” update to the rules.

If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the **[Polymarket Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket)** **#market-review** channel.
