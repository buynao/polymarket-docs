# How are Markets Created?#

## Market creation#

**Markets are created by the markets team with input from users and the community.**

## Can I create my own market?#

While users cannot directly create their own markets, they are encouraged to suggest ideas for new markets. In choosing which markets to list, Polymarket considers the following factors:

Is there enough demand for trading in the market to produce an accurate probability? Polymarket targets $X in trading volume as a minimum.

Is there social good or news value in understanding the probability generated by the market?

Can the market be resolved clearly?

Is there a credible information source for market resolution?

_For example, a countryâ€™s elections commission can be specified as the official resolution source for an election._

Can the market be resolved in a definitive time frame?

### Submit your market proposal#

To give your proposal the best chance of being listed, include as much information as possible, such as:

  * What is the market title?
  * What is the [resolution source](/docs/guides/markets/how-are-markets-resolved)?
  * Evidence of demand for trading that market



The best ways to propose a new market are:

  * On **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket)** in the **#market-suggestion** channel
  * On Twitter / X by tagging **[@polymarket](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I+have+an+idea+for+a+new+market+@polymarket)**
