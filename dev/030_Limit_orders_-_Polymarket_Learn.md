## What are Limit Orders?#

Limit orders are open orders (pending trades) that only execute when the market trades at your desired price.

For example, if the highest you’re willing to pay for a share of Trump “Yes” in the 2024 Republican Nomination is 72c, but the current market price is 73c, you could create a limit order at 72c and wait until someone is willing to sell Yes shares at your desired price.

It’s not necessary for the entire order to execute at once. Limit orders can ‘partially fill’ as individual traders fill parts of your order.

### How to make a Limit Order#

In the buy modal, select **limit** in the order type dropdown.

Enter the price you are willing to buy (or sell, if you’ve selected to sell) shares at.

Enter the number of shares you want to buy or sell at that price.

_Optional: Set an expiration date for your limit order. This means that if the order does not execute at your desired price within this timeframe, it will be canceled._

Click **Buy** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Your limited orders that have yet to be filled are called "Open Orders".

You'll see a **“Your deposit is pending”** screen. You'll receive a confirmation email from Coinbase when your USDC purchase is successful.

## Managing limit orders#

When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page.

If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the **[Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders)**.

## Canceling limit orders#

When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page.

To cancel the order, you can simply click the red **x** button alongside the order.

If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the **[Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders)**.

Nice! You can officially call yourself an advanced trader.
