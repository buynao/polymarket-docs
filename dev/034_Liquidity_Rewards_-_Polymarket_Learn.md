# Liquidity Rewards Program#

With Polymarket's Liquidity Rewards Program, you can earn money by placing limit orders that help keep the market active and balanced.

## Overview#

  * The closer your orders are to the market's average price, the more you earn.

  * The reward amount depends on how helpful your orders are in terms of size and pricing compared to others.

  * The more competitive your limit orders, the more you can make.

  * You get paid daily based on how much your orders add to the market, and can use our **[Rewards page](https://polymarket.com/rewards)** to check your current earnings for the day, which markets have rewards in place, as well as how much.

Simply put, the more you help the market by placing good orders, the more rewards you earn!

## Seeing Rewards in the Order Book#

### Viewing Rewards#

The total rewards, max spread, and minimum shares required to earn rewards vary by market. You can view the rewards for a given market in its Order Book.

  * On the Polymarket order book, you can hover over the Rewards text to see the amount of rewards available in total on each market.

  * The blue highlighted lines correspond to the max spread — meaning the farthest distance your limit order can be from the midpoint of the market to earn rewards.

  * In the example below, because the max spread is 3c, every order within 3c of the midpoint is eligible for rewards. If the midpoint is < $0.10, you need to have orders on both sides to qualify.
