FAQs

# Is my money safe?#

**Yes. Polymarket is non-custodial, so you're in control of your funds.**

### Non-custodial, youâ€™re in control#

Polymarket recognizes the importance of a trustworthy environment for managing your funds. To ensure this, Polymarket uses non-custodial wallets, meaning we never take possession of your USDC. This approach gives you full control over your assets, providing protection against potential security threats like hacks, misuse, and unauthorized transactions.

### Your keys = your funds#

A private key acts like a highly secure password, essential for managing and moving your assets without restrictions. You can export your private key at any time, ensuring sole access to your funds. Learn how to export your private key [here](/docs/guides/FAQ/how-to-export-private-key).

### Keep your private keys private.#

**Do not share your private key with others**. While Polymarket provides the infrastructure, the security of your assets depends on how securely you handle your private key and passwords. Losing your private key or passwords can result in losing access to your funds. It's crucial to store this information in a safe and secure environment.

### Our Commitment#

Polymarket aims to give you peace of mind, knowing that your assets are safe and fully under your control at all times. We encourage you to take necessary precautions to secure your digital assets effectively. The ability to manage your private key means you are not reliant on Polymarket to secure your assets; you have the control to ensure your financial security.
