# Does Polymarket Have Trading Limits?#

By design, the Polymarket orderbook **does not** have trading size limits. It matches willing buyers and sellers of any amount.

However, there is no guarantee that it will be possible to transact a desired amount of shares without impacting the price significantly, or at all if there are no willing counterparties. Before trading in any market, especially in large size, it is valuable to look at the orderbook to understand depth of liquidity, ie how many buyers or sellers are in the market and their desired trade size and price.
